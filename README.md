# Yammie-api
<h1>Intro:</h1>
<p>
    Yammie restaurant has recently gained a huge success and popularity and
    would like to expand and start offering their services online.
    They want to optimize their ordering process, and in order to achieve the
    best optimization, they have already developed a Client solution based on
    React.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    At this point they reached out to us and asked our developers to implement
    a Backend API to manage their orders.
    In this exercise you will be asked to implement a Rest API backend for the
    restaurant according to the following instructions:
    Server Functionality:
    The API should support the next functionality:
    <ul>
        <li>- Save new order</li>
        <li>- Get all orders from the last day</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Think of the best design to achieve this goal and implement it.
    The API should be informative, understandable, and easy to consume.
